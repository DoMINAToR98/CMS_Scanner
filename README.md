## 1. Introduction to problem

Acenka is a GUI-based website vulnerability scanner which scans websites that
use Control Management Systems (CMS) like Wordpress, Drupal and Joomla and also shows server related misconfigurations such as open ports, os versions etc.<br>
The scanner performs extensive scans on the website to find the CMS used and
possible vulnerabilities that can be reported and/or fixed.<br>These vulnerabilities
include, but are not limited to:

- Cross- Site Scripting (XSS)
- SQL injection
- Authentication
- Clickjacking
- HTML Injection
- User Info Exposure
- Local File Inclusion
- Remote File Inclusion
- Arbitrary File Inclusion
- API Endpoint Injection<br>

---

Acenka will scan the target website by just entering the website in the text field
and reporting everything in a text-based format. It has a simple GUI format, which
makes it easier for both experienced and new users to check for vulnerabilities in the
target website.

## 2. Usability of project

Acenka can be used for:

- Automated testing for websites as most of the websites use Wordpress, Joomla or Drupal as their CMS.
- Extremely simple user interface, as most the fledgling developers have no idea about how to secure the product. It can be easily used by them.
- Even scans the network upto some extent, to give a broader outlook if something major is missing on the server which is hosting the website.
